        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This banana bread recipe creates the most delicious, moist loaf with loads of banana flavor. Why compromise the banana<br> flavor? Friends and family love my recipe and say it's by far the best! It tastes wonderful toasted. Enjoy!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour gives the banana bread structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Baking soda:</strong> Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the banana bread rise.</li>
                <li><strong>Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make the loaf taste salty.</li>
                <li><strong>Butter:</strong> A stick of butter lends richness, moisture, and irresistible flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Brown sugar:</strong> Brown sugar sweetens things up and adds a hint of warmth.</li>
                <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Eggs act as a binding agent, which means they hold the batter together.</li>
                <li><strong>Bananas:</strong> Of course, you'll need bananas! Choose overripe bananas.</li>
            </ul>
